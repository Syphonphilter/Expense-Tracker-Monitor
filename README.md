Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
<<<<<<< HEAD
bun create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
bun create svelte@latest my-app
=======
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
>>>>>>> 7b0a92c (init)
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
=======
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
>>>>>>> 7b0a92c (init)
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
bun run build
=======
npm run build
>>>>>>> 7b0a92c (init)
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
